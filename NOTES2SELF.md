# Notes to Self
## TODO
1. Code Cleanup
    - bogus user agents, state
2. UI aesthetics
    - upgrading materialize gets rid of autocomplete naming conflict
        - but breaks how the form looks
    - Subreddit autocomplete
        - SUBMIT button ends up above dropdown list
            - maybe limit size of dropdown list
            - supposed to be fixed in v1.0.0-alpha but doesn't appear to be the case
                - open Github issue?
        - validate that subreddit field starts with `/r/` (or is empty string)
